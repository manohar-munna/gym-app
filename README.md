### **Instructions to Finalize:**
1.  **Screenshots:** I added placeholder images. For the best result, take 1 or 2 screenshots of your live website and upload them to your repo (create a folder named `assets` or `screenshots`), then replace the `https://via.placeholder.com...` links with the relative path to your images (e.g., `./assets/dashboard.png`).
2.  **Environment Variables:** If you are using **RapidAPI** (common for gym apps), keep the Env Variables section. If you are using a custom backend or no API, you can remove that section.
